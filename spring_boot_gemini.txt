Spring Core is the foundational module of the Spring Framework, providing the core functionalities that all other Spring modules are built upon.
 At its heart, it's about **dependency injection (DI)** and the **Inversion of Control (IoC) container**.

### Key Concepts

* **Inversion of Control (IoC):** Instead of you creating and managing the dependencies your application needs (like manually instantiating an object), the Spring IoC container does it for you. This flips the control of object creation from your code to the framework.
* **Dependency Injection (DI):** This is a specific implementation of IoC. The IoC container "injects" the required dependencies into a class at runtime. This makes your code more modular, testable, and easier to maintain because components are loosely coupled.
* **Beans:** In Spring, the objects that form the backbone of your application are called **beans**. These are managed by the IoC container. You define how these beans are created and wired together in configuration files (like XML) or, more commonly now, with annotations.

Essentially, Spring Core handles the lifecycle of your application's objects and manages how they interact with each other, freeing you to focus on the business logic. It's the central nervous system of any Spring application.
